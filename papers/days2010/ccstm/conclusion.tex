CCSTM demonstrates that it is possible to provide a library-only
implementation of STM for Scala.  The resulting
syntax is relatively concise and the performance is on par with a bytecode
rewriting STM.  The transactional references that encode CCSTM's interface
add some clutter to the user's code, but they also provide a natural way
for the programmer to take advantage of more sophisticated features such
as semantic conflict detection.

We found that the primary challenge in our approach was that statically
scoped transactions reduce composability.  The next step for CCSTM is
to explore a hybrid approach that uses static scopes for barriers but
dynamic scopes to coordinate nested transactions.
