The most fundamental data type in CCSTM is \xtype{Ref}{A}, which mediates
access to an STM-managed value.  Read-only methods are separated into
a covariant \type{Source} trait and write-only methods are separated
into a contravariant \type{Sink} trait.  Instances of \type{Ref} are
independent of the current transactional context, so the context is
passed during each method call via an implicit parameter.

\caption{Traits that provide access to an STM-managed memory
location.  Transactional access can occur through either \type{Ref}
or a \type{Ref.Bound} returned from \type{Ref}\code{.bind},
non-transactional access occurs through a \type{Ref.Bound} returned
from \type{Ref}\code{.nonTxn}.  \ytype{Source}{+A} and \ytype{Sink}{-A}
decompose the covariant and contravariant operations of \ytype{Ref}{A}.}

Non-transactional access to the contents of a reference are provided by
a view returned by \code{nonTxn}.  This view implements methods that
parallel those of the reference, but that don't require a \type{Txn}.
We say that the view is \textit{bound} to the non-transactional
context, so the view trait is named \type{Ref.Bound}.  Views may
also be bound to a transactional context via \type{Ref}\code{.bind}.
Figure~\ref{fig:refclasses} shows the \keyword{extends} relationship
between the traits that implement unbound and bound references, and 
some of their methods.

Bound views for non-transactional access create a syntactic difference
between transactional and non-transactional reads and writes.
This allows the expert programmer to selectively relax isolation by
performing a non-transactional access inside an atomic block, without
requiring an escape action~\cite{escapeaction}.  The non-isolated access
is visually differentiated by including the token \code{nonTxn}.  In
Section~\ref{sec:unrecordedread} we will introduce \code{unrecordedRead},
a way of relaxing isolation for reads while retaining the ability to
manually validate.
