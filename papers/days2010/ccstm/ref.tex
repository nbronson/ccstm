The most fundamental data type in CCSTM is \xtype{Ref}{A}, which provides
access to an STM-managed value.

is a
mutable cell holding a value of type \typeparam{A}.  The fundamental
operations on \type{Ref} are \code{get} and \code{set}, which perform
a transactional read and a transactional write, respectively.

\caption{Traits that provide access to an STM-managed memory
location.  Transactional access can occur through either \type{Ref}
or a \type{Ref.Bound} returned from \type{Ref}\code{.bind},
non-transactional access occurs through a \type{Ref.Bound} returned
from \type{Ref}\code{.nonTxn}.  \ytype{Source}{+A} and \ytype{Sink}{-A}
decompose the covariant and contravariant operations of \ytype{Ref}{A}.}
