\caption{Traits that provide access to an STM-managed memory
location.  Transactional access can occur through either \type{Ref}
or a \type{Ref.Bound} returned from \type{Ref}\code{.bind},
non-transactional access occurs through a \type{Ref.Bound} returned
from \type{Ref}\code{.nonTxn}.  \xtype{Source}{+A} and \xtype{Sink}{-A}
decompose the covariant and contravariant operations of \xtype{Ref}{A}.}
