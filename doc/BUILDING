To build CCSTM using the ant build script:

1) Set up system.properties to point to your JDK, Scala, and ScalaTest
installations.

   cp system.properties.example system.properties
   $VISUAL system.properties

2) Build

   ant all

3) Generate the docs.  This step uses maruku as a Markdown processor, but
that's easy to disable if you don't want it.  Scaladoc ends up in
out/apidoc/ .

   bin/gen_doc

4) Run the full test and performance suite (this will take a while).  If you
have a late-model JVM you can add --esc immediately after bin/proj_scala to
enable dynamic escape analysis.

   bin/proj_scala org.scalatest.tools.Runner -o -p out/test/classes/

Tested with Sun's 1.6.0_16 JDK, Scala version 2.7.6, and ScalaTest 0.9.5
